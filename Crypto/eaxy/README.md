This challenge deals with XOR putting this into Cyberchef we can see that its printing the character index for each key we use , and i tested this at first with Cyberchef and CTRL+F the word challenge and we can find character indexes.

So we can make a script to find all these Character Indexes and then combine the hex value of the string and convert those hex to text and we get our flag.
